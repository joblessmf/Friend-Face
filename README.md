## üß† What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Structuring a SwiftUI app using the MVVM pattern.
- Fetching and decoding remote JSON with nested relationships.
- Passing model data between multiple SwiftUI views.
- Formatting and displaying dates in a user-friendly way.
- Building a navigation flow using `NavigationStack` and `NavigationLink`.
- Organizing Swift files for better maintainability.

## üíº About Me

I‚Äôm currently building my portfolio as I transition into iOS development. This app showcases my ability to integrate remote data with a clean, navigable SwiftUI interface, as part of the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) curriculum.
